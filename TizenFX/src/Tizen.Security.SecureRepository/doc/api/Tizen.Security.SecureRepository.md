uid: Tizen.Security.SecureRepository
summary: Secure Repository function is provided by key-manager module in Tizen. The key manager provides a secure repository for keys, certificates, and sensitive data related to users and their password-protected APPs. Additionally, it provides secure cryptographic operations for non-exportable keys without revealing the key values to clients.

## Overview
Secure Repository stores keys, certificates, and sensitive user data in a central secure repository. The central secure repository is protected by a password.

### Data Store Policy
A client can specify simple access rules when storing data in the key manager:

* Extractable or non-extractable
  - Only for data tagged as extractable, the key manager returns the raw value of the data.
  -  If data is tagged as non-extractable, the key manager does not return its raw value. In that case, the key manager provides secure cryptographic operations for non-exportable keys without revealing the key values to the clients.
* Per key password
  - All data in the key manager is protected by a user password.
  - A client can encrypt its data using their own password additionally.
  - If a client provides a password when storing data, the data is encrypted with the password. This password must be provided when getting the data from the key manager.

### Data Access Control
  - By default, only the owner of a data can access to the data.
  - If the owner grants the access to other applications, those applications can read or delete the data from key-manager DB.
  - When an application is deleted, the data and access control information granted by the application are also removed.

### Alias Format
  - The format of alias is "package_id name" and the name should not contain any white space characters.
  - If package_id is not provided by a client, the key-manager will add the package_id of the client to the name internally.
  - The client can specify only its own pacakge id in the alias when storing a key, certificate, or data.
  - A client should specify the pacakge id of the owner in the alias to retrieve a a key, certificate, or data shared by other applications.
  - Aliases are returned from the key-manager as the format of package_id name.
